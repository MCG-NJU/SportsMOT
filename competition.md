# Issues about the competition 

## Formats

Submission should be put directly in the root folder of your zip

[After unzipping]

```text
- v_XXX.txt
- v_XXX.txt
```

i.e. Submission should be in `ROOT/v_XXX.txt` instead of `ROOT/SOME_SUBFOLDER/v_XXX.txt`

:exclamation: There is limit for submissions during testing phase. Considering the sake of fairness, it's really troublesome to cope with wrong submission formats.

:exclamation: ***please CAREFULLY check the format before submitting zipped results.***

## README for test phase

These info below should be provided as the **submission description**.

*Since participants may submit multiple results, we recommend to keep the README INFO consistent throughout the test phase.*

*At least, the **description of the final submission** should contain these info for confirmation.*


*EXAMPLE*


```text
Name: John 
Team: MCG NJU
Email: john@abc.com
Affiliation: Multimedia Computing Group, Nanjing University
Whether willing to offer report: Yes
```

*NOTE*

- `Team` is required if you are participating together with others
  - All of the participants in a team should share the same `Team` name.
- `Affiliation` should be the full name, which can be easily recognized.
- ðŸ“ƒ `Report` means a `pdf` which clearly explains the **models**, **settings** and **tricks** supporting the results.

## Errors

```text
WARNING: Your kernel does not support swap limit capabilities or the cgroup is not mounted. Memory limited without swap.
```

Just ignore this. 


```text
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 28] No space left on device
```

It's caused by the unstable server instead of the uploaded files. Resubmit, please.
